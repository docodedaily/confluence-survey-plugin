Introduction

Welcome to the readme Confluence-Survey-Plugin Page.

Usage

Since Version 1.2.9 the Macro Browser is quite comfortably described to use, but you are welcome to read the documentation

This file is merely a placeholder for the wiki documentation.

History
=======

The Plugin originated in 2006 and was taken over for maintenance in 2008, that time it was quite unsupported.

I maintained it until i had no personel access to a confluence installation anymore (2011).

As in 2012 the JIRA Studio at Atlassian closed its doors i had to find another location. Welcome GitHub ;)
In June 2013 i had quite some inquiries to carry on, so i am currently evaluating some things (compatibility, documentation, maybe features).

Main focus is maintenance, test coverage and getting the thing somehow usable with the macro browser.

If someone feels to help out, feel free to contact me.
