Introduction
============

The confluence-survey-plugin is as the name implies a plugin for Atlassian Confluence. Started quite a long time  back for compatibility to 2.1.4 to the very latest 5.4++. The latest compatibility can be accessed within the Marketplace @ https://marketplace.atlassian.com/195.

Usage
=====

Since Version 1.2.9 the Macro Browser is quite comfortably described to use, but you are welcome to read the documentation in the wiki at: https://github.com/drohne1673/confluence-survey-plugin/wiki/Usage

This file is merely a placeholder for the wiki documentation.

Plugin development
==================

The plugin is a maven artifact and therefore can be built with Maven 3 and JDK 7.

History
=======

The Plugin originated in 2006 and was taken over for maintenance in 2008, that time it was quite unsupported.

I maintained it until i had no personel access to a confluence installation anymore (2011).

As in 2012 the JIRA Studio at Atlassian closed its doors i had to find another location. Welcome GitHub ;)
In June 2013 i had quite some inquiries to carry on, so i am currently evaluating some things (compatibility, documentation, maybe features).

Main focus is maintenance, test coverage and getting the thing somehow usable with the macro browser.

If someone feels to help out, feel free to contact me.
